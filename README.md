# Bridge app by Pietrass and Lehu

## Introduction
In this project we focus on creating `bridge app`. It's an app especially for bridge players or fans, who want to monitor their progress. 
Our projects consists of 2 parts. Firstly, we structure and prepare data. After creating some functions which return data frames, we go ahead to second part
In this part we try to develop web app, which use data from part 1. Especially important is for us design of our application. 
In this `README file` we describe all commits.

## Directory final version
It's directory with the newest version of our app. We try to keep it quite representative. Unfortunately, we began writing code in Polish for example names of variables.
However, the most of code and comment is in English, so we hope that everyone understand what is going on in our project. In moment of free time we try to fix it.

## Commits before 20th July
Before 20th July we were preparing mainly scratch of code. Obviously, it was really helpful to create final version, but we don't think is necessary to describe it.

## 20th July Finish of preparing data
- we managed to commit code, which returns number of data frames which help us to build our web app
- all of our activities were described in `Bridge app- data processing.ipynb file`
- we create also exemplary data frames, which show output of our functions

## 15th September Finish of creating our project
- we added mobile version of our website
- we managed to connect data base with our python file
- to update data base and folder with jsons we have to run only 2 functions ( full description in .ipynb file)
- we deleted all unnecessary folders on github

## Last task
In this moment our website is running locally but we try to set up web hosting. After that we add a link to the website.

## Short description
- Directory `Bridge Site` consists of all frontend files and folder `results` where you can find `.json` files using to create charts 
- In directory `Final_version` you can find all connected with backend: DB connection, python scripts and some data frames
  - In the file `Bridge app- data processing.ipynb` we tried to described all functions and way to update our website. There you can find more explanations about our         work
